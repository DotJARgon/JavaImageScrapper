# JavaImageScrapper

This is a basic image scrapper using JSoup. An interesting problem I ran into was that apparently google changed the way encodes image links.

Most every tutorial was outdated and didn't work, so I had to figure out how it worked myself! Hopefully this will help any other intrepid Java programmers out there that want to make a Java image scrapper using google image search and JSoup.

Please enjoy and feel free to use (if you could at least credi me that would be nice)
